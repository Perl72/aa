            "We admitted we were powerless over our addiction/compulsion \u2013 that our lives had become unmanageable.",
            "We came to believe that, like all human beings, our power was limited, and we needed to learn to let go and learn from others.",
            "We made a decision to let go of control, assume a spirit of goodwill, seek the wisdom of responsible others, and discover our true 'voice within.'",
            "We made a searching and fearless inventory of our strengths and weaknesses.",
            "We admitted to our journal, ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.",
            "Were entirely ready to listen to wise counsel and seek that still small voice within to guide us to change our behaviors which have been harmful to ourselves and others.",
            "Humbly began the process of deep change so we could overcome our weakness.",
            "Made a list of all persons we have harmed, became willing to make amends to them all, and to forgive those against whom we have held grudges.",
            "We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.",
            "Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.",
            "Through meditation and journaling we continually seek to clarify and improve our own judgment and to consider the best direction and purpose our lives can take.",
            "Having developed deeper wisdom and an appreciation of the spiritual as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to other addicts and to practice these principles in all our affairs."
