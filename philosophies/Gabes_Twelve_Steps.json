        "We admitted we could not control our drinking, nor do without it, that our lives had become unmanageable.",
        "We came to believe that others who had had or understood our problem could help us return to and maintain sanity.",
        "We decided to accept what they said and act on their suggestions.",
        "We made a searching inventory of our bad feelings, of those aspects of our own character that had contributed to these and of the harms we had done. We noted occasions where we had done well and were glad of these.",
        "We showed the inventory to at least one other person and discussed it with them.",
        "We accepted our moral and personal weaknesses, and accepted that they needed to change.",
