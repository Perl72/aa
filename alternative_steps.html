            <ol>
                <li>We accept the fact that all our efforts to stop drinking have failed.</li>
                <li>We believe that we must turn elsewhere for help.</li>
                <li>We turn to our fellow men and women, particularly those who have struggled with the same problem.</li>
                <li>We have made a list of the situations in which we are most likely to drink.</li>
                <li>We ask our friends to help us avoid those situations.</li>
                <li>We are ready to accept the help they give us.</li>
                <li>We honestly hope they will help.</li>
                <li>We have made a list of the persons we have harmed and to whom we hope to make amends.</li>
                <li>We shall do all we can to make amends, in any way that will not cause further harm.</li>
                <li>We will continue to make such lists and revise them as needed.</li>
                <li>We appreciate what our friends have done and are doing to help us.</li>
                <li>We, in turn, are ready to help others who may come to us in the same way.</li>

            <h2>Buddhist Non-Theist 12 Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>We admitted our addictive craving over alcohol and recognized its consequences in our lives.</li>
                <li>Came to believe that a power other than self could restore us to wholeness.</li>
                <li>Made a decision to go for refuge to this other power as we understood it.</li>
                <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
                <li>Admitted to ourselves and another human being the exact moral nature of our past.</li>
                <li>Became entirely ready to work at transforming ourselves.</li>
                <li>With the assistance of others and our own firm resolve, we transformed unskillful aspects of ourselves and cultivated positive ones.</li>
                <li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed.</li>
                <li>Made direct amends to such people where possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. Additionally, made a conscientious effort to forgive all those who harmed us.</li>
                <li>Continue to maintain awareness of our actions and motives, and when we acted unskillfully, promptly admitted it.</li>
                <li>Engaged through the practice of meditation to improve our conscious contact with our true selves and seeking that beyond self. Also, used prayer as a means to cultivate positive attitudes and states of mind.</li>
                <li>Having gained spiritual insight as a result of these steps, we practice these principles in all areas of our lives and make this message available to others in need of recovery.</li>
